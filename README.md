# README-Generator

## Description

This is a command-line application that allows the users to answer questions and have a README populated for them to us on their project and future projects.


## Problem Solved

The README generator allows the user to quickly input data for their README so they do not have have to spend much time worrying about the layout.

## What I learned

There are many things I have learned from this project. One big take away was getting first hand experience to using node, specifically with inquirer and learning about all the additional packages that can be added into node in order to help with parts of a project.

## Installation

To install you just need to have the node installed on your desktop and to next install inquirer into your terminal.

## Usage

1. Open up the terminal, 2. type in node and then your file name, 3. answer the questions one by one, 4. once finished you will find your myREADme file created
